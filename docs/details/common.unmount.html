Unmounts the widget and cleans up resources

<div class="definition">
    unmount()
</div>

<div class="arguments">
    <table>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2">No arguments</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<h4>Description</h4>

This method unmounts the widget by calling the parent class unmount method and cleaning up any associated objects. It also disconnects any observers and removes event handlers.

<textarea class="javascript">
let widget = new w2[widgetType]({
    name: 'myWidget',
    // ... other options
});

// Later, when you want to clean up
widget.unmount();
</textarea>

This method is typically called automatically when the widget is destroyed or when re-rendering into a new container.
