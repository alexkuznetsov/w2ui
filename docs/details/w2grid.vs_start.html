Defines the number of records in the grid when to start virtualization

<div class="definition">
    Number, default = 150
</div>

Virtualization is the process when only records in the current scroll window are added to the actual DOM tree. This approach
allows grid to have millions of records and still be snappy. So, if grid has less than 150 records, all of them will be available
in the DOM, however, if more, only the records that are in the view.

<div style="height: 10px"></div>
You should not normally change this property.
